# Frontend - Quotes API

In this website, we are using the Quotes API that we have made in another repository (becode-quotes-api). The link to our API is:  https://becodequotes-api.herokuapp.com/quotes

Link to published site using the api: https://sonia012.github.io/becode-quotes-api-frontend/

This project has been done in February 2019. The purpose was to use an API of quotes made by ourselves.  In this project, we made the backend and the frontend.
